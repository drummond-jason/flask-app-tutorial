# flask-app-tutorial
This is a flask app I am building based on a tutorial so that I can learn

Starting after downloading:
1. Create the virtual env: virtual venv
2. Run the virtual environment (on Windows): ./venv/Scripts/activate
3. Set the environment variables: $env:FLASK_APP='flaskblog.py'
4. Set the environment debug level: $env:FLASK_DEBUG=1
5. Run Flask: flask run
