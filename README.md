# flask-app-tutorial
This is a flask app I am building based on a tutorial so that I can learn

Starting after downloading:
1. create the databases from command line:
    a. python
    b. from flaskblog import db
    c. db.create_all()
2. Create the virtual env: virtual venv
3. Run the virtual environment (on Windows): ./venv/Scripts/activate
4. Set the environment variables: $env:FLASK_APP='flaskblog.py'
5. Set the environment debug level: $env:FLASK_DEBUG=1
6. Run Flask: flask run
